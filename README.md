# AudiThor-AWS ‚ö°Ô∏è

**A security auditing tool for AWS, with a focus on PCI DSS compliance.**
AudiThor is a local web application that provides a unified dashboard for conducting read-only security audits in AWS environments. It allows auditors, administrators, and security teams to get a quick and comprehensive overview of an account's security posture, identify potential risks, and verify policy compliance, especially those related to the PCI DSS standard.

## üéØ Who Is This Tool For?

AudiThor-AWS is specifically designed for **audit teams and security professionals** who need to assess AWS environments for compliance purposes. Traditionally, audit teams have faced significant challenges in:

- **Limited AWS Visibility**: Gaining comprehensive oversight of complex cloud environments across multiple regions and services
- **Evidence Collection Bottlenecks**: Manually gathering security evidence from dozens of AWS services for compliance frameworks
- **Time-Intensive Audits**: Spending weeks collecting basic configuration data instead of analyzing security posture
- **Compliance Gap Identification**: Quickly identifying non-compliance with standards like PCI DSS, SOC 2, SWIFT, and ISO 27001
- **Cross-Service Correlation**: Understanding how security configurations interact across different AWS services

This tool addresses these pain points by providing:
- **Automated Evidence Collection**: Gather security configurations from 20+ AWS services in minutes
- **Compliance-Focused Analysis**: Built-in rules for PCI DSS 3.2.1/4.0.1, CIS Benchmark, and AWS security best practices
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: AI-powered executive summaries and detailed technical findings
- **Risk Prioritization**: Severity-based findings to focus on critical security gaps first

Whether you're conducting PCI DSS assessments, SOC 2 audits, SWIFT compliance reviews, or general security assessments, AudiThor-AWS transforms weeks of manual evidence gathering into automated, comprehensive analysis.

The majority of this project was developed with the assistance of an AI language model (Google's Gemini), which helped accelerate the implementation of various checks and the creation of the dashboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend (audithor.py):** Python 3, Flask, Boto3
* **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Python 3.8+** and `pip`.
2.  The **`sslscan`** command-line tool. It is used by the "SSL Scan" module in the Playground.
    * **On Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install sslscan`
    * **On macOS (with Homebrew):** `brew install sslscan`
    * **On Windows:** You can download the binaries from the [official sslscan repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rbsec/sslscan/releases).
3.  **(Optional) A Google Gemini API Key:** To use the AI report generation feature, you will need an API key.
    * You can get a free key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    * **Important:** The key is used directly from your browser to communicate with the Google API and is **never stored on the local server**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/audithor.git
    cd audithor
    ```
   

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it
    # On Linux/macOS:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
   

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Run the Flask server:**
    ```bash
    python audithor.py
    ```
    The application will start and automatically open a new tab in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5001/dashboard.html`.

2.  **Enter your AWS credentials:**
    * You will need an **Access Key ID** and a **Secret Access Key** from an IAM user or role.
    * If you are using temporary credentials, you must also provide the **Session Token**.

    > **‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Permissions:**
    > For the tool to work correctly, the provided credentials must have read-only permissions for the services to be audited. A good starting point is to attach the AWS-managed policies `SecurityAudit` and `ViewOnlyAccess` to the IAM user or role.

3.  **Click "Analyze Account"** and explore the results in the different modules.

4.  **(Optional) Generate an AI Report:**
    * Navigate to the **"Healthy Status"** module and select the **"Generate Report"** tab.
    * Paste your **Google Gemini API Key** into the corresponding field.
    * Adjust the prompt if you wish and click **"Generate Email Draft"**.

### üîí Important! Credential Handling

This tool runs **entirely locally on your machine**. The credentials you enter in the browser are sent only to your local server (the `audithor.py` script) and never leave your computer. However, it is always a good practice to:
* Use temporary credentials (Session Tokens) whenever possible.
* Do not save your credentials in insecure locations.
* Run the tool in a trusted environment.

## üîÑ Performance Improvements

The latest version includes significant performance enhancements:
- **Multi-threaded analysis** for internet exposure detection
